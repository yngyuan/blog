Hello world! 你好世界！I am Yang, a master's student at University of Texas at Austin. 

I majored in Computing Science(Mathematics) in my undergraduate study and it gave me an instinct for data analysis and a mindset that nothing can be harder than my major. 

Prior to master’s study, I had internships at Tencent and Amazon, where I worked as a product manager and data analyst intern. I also worked as a software engineer intern at a startup. I love working with people from different disciplines and I am amazed by the creativity we sparked together in an agile team.

My Résumé
============
Education
---------

2019-2021 (expected)
:   **MsC, Information Science**; University of Texas at Austin

2015-2019

   **Minor: Computer Science **

Internships
----------

**Tencent Inc.** *Beijing, China*    May. 2018 -- Sep. 2018

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtaine

* Designed various A/B Tests and analyzed user behaviours and feed-backs for growth hacking of product.
* Built a Machine Learning model in Python, implementing Cluster Algorithms to draw App user profile.
* Owned and designed AARRR user acquisition analysis using HiveQL and Python.

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**Amazon Inc.** *Beijing, China*     Dec. 2017 -- Feb. 2018

* Initiated and implemented web crawlers to compare book prices among shopping websites.
* Provided data support for the product team, including designing SQL and data analysis on Onsite decisions.     


Projects
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
----------------------
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Miscellaneous
----------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
