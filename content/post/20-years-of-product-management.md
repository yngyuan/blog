Notes from 20 Years of Product Management in 25 Minutes by Dave Wascha.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/davewascha/

#### Listen to Customers for Problems

Spend more time listen to your customers. You cannot solve the customers's problems withoug understanding it.

#### Don't Listen to Customers for solutions

Because they don't know what they want.

#### Watch the Competition for Customer Research

Not from just reading techcrunch articles. 

#### Don't Watch the Competition for the Buzz

Do you really need it? Does it really help solve the problem?

#### Be a Thief

If something is working, be a thief. You don't have to come up everything on your own.

#### Get Paid

Evernote example. 

- Pricing problem, 60Mb, letting the user do math.
- Customer Support only for premium.(they are only getting what they paid for when things go wrong.)

#### Stop Worrying about Getting Paid

It slow us down and creates a culture of systemic risk aversion. 

If you can make somebody smile, you got it covered. Be there not only for their functional needs, but also for their emotional needs.

- a beef jerky food with floss inside for you.
- Frost and defrost card with the animation.
- Pagerduty ringtongs

#### Speed UP!

Notice the cost of not doing something, the cost of delay.

#### Say, 'NO'

You have many stakeholders, but your job is not to make everyone happy. Say no for the right reason, for the product, for the customer but not because you don't like the people suggesting it.

#### Don't be a Visionary

Products don't need visionary, they need pms who are obsessed with understanding user's problems and solve them.

#### Don't Confuse yourself with a Customer

PMs who think they know their customers is like a male gynecologist.

#### Be Dumb!

Be dumb when you are not encumbered by knowledge and inertia. The best PM have the capacity to be dumb to always look at a situation through the eyes of a customer.

#### Finally, make your own mistakes and don't listen to me.
